# Very much a work in progress. 

0% chance of working lmao (I just copy pasted the code from a different project)

# TODO
- [ ] Remove dependency on cuid2 (maybe?)
- [ ] use `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`
- [ ] Remove dependency on date-fns (effect/DateTime should be able to handle it)
- [ ] Remove dependency on kysely (switch to @effect/sql-mysql2)
- [ ] Set up migrations function that runs whenever the queue starts
- [ ] Remove dependency on Zod and support any validator
